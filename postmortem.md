# Assignment 1 Postmortem

## What's your past experience with front-end development?
I've made a few small websites and have also edited CSS on tumblr blogs for fun.


## How difficult was this assignment?
The assignment wasn't difficult at all; the hardest part was trying to find out where my mistake was in typing the code. Turns out I had used href- instead of href= and it messed everything up :(.


## Did you learn anything new from this assignment?
I didn't really learn anything new, although it was my first time using a <button> tag rather than type="button".


## How could this assignment be improved?
I think this was a perfect first assignment, especially with the walkthrough, for people who haven't touched HTML/CSS/JS and are starting to learn.


## Any other comments?
I'm very excited to be in this class this semester and to further my knowledge of front-end development.
